A short memo for upgrading XPointProjectManagement to Plone 3.
====================================================================

0. It is very good chance to rename the field and re-organize the 
class hierache.

1. declare index for all fields need a index and metadata, DONE.

2. manage and organize the shemata properly!
Method finalizeATCTSchema will re-organize the shemata for Plone 3.0
Bascially, after this method, we can move/reorganize any fields.

3. how to remove properties tab (metadata), since we got new look/feel 
from Plone 3.0.  the method finalizeATCTSchema.
Here is a sample from PoiResponse.py:

def modify_fti(fti):
    # Hide unnecessary tabs (usability enhancement)
    for a in fti['actions']:
        if a['id'] in ['metadata', 'sharing']:
            a['visible'] = 0
    return fti

4, how to migrate the skin (view.pt) from macro to viewlet.  viewlet is 
the standard start from Plone 3.

5. notification email for content change.
