iScorpio PloneLab is where we try out the Plone 3 Development!

upcoming lab:

- unit testing for browser page / view

- generic setup handler, and it's adapter:
  Plone's default properties tool is a good simple example.
 - define the interface
 - class extends the xmlbaseadapter
 - register it adapter in configure.zcml
 - ???
 - this normally come with a CMF tool, but not necessary!
   plone.app.portlets is an example without CMF tool
