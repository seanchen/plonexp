0.3 - Single Sign On with LDAP support
--------------------------------------

For this release we are tying to using LDAP server as the user account
source for single sign on solution.  We will still leverage a Plone 
site for the user account management.

It depends on the following products:
Products.LDAPUserFolder
Products.LDAPMultiPlugins
Products.PloneLDAP
simplon.plone.ldap

We need a bit patch for Products.PloneLDAP product, please check the 
file sso.patch for details.

We also added unit test cases and GenericSetup Profiles for this
release.  Now the a setup handler will activate and deactivate plugins
when we install this product.


0.2 - Single Sign On Solution
-----------------------------

This solution will try to use a Plone site to provide centralized User 
account management.

User Admin Plone Site Configuration

1. using Cookie Auth Helper from Product.PluggableAuthService instead of 
Extended Cookie Auth Helper from Products.PlonePAS.

2. deactivate all plugins for session

New PAS plugins for each Plone site:

1. forward the following plugins to UserAdmin:
    - IPropertiesPlugin ==> mutable_properties
    - IAuthenticationPlugin ==> source_users
    - IUserEnumerationPlugin ==> source_users and mutable_properties
    - ICredentialsUpdatePlugin ==> credentials_auth_helper
    - IExtractionPlugin ==> credentials_auth_helper

2. configure the Plone site acl_users to use the new plugins for those
   services related to user.  Other services such as role and group should
   remain the same as no touch!


0.1 - Mini Single Sign On
-------------------------

* Using a CMF folder to privide centralized user account management for 
as set of Plone sites.  Which only has 2 plugins: ZODB User Manager and
Cookie Auth Helper.

* Using credentials_cookie_auth for user authentication and credential 
management.

* Very easy Plone PAS plugin for each Plone site to forward authentication
and credetial management services to the CMF folder.

* ??? need manually create and configure plugins for acl_users.

* ??? User account does NOT have any other properties other than user id 
and password.
